  Hello from LarpFic!

  You're receiving this e-mail because you had works in a fanworks archive that has been imported by Open Doors (http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org) into LarpFic (LF - <%= root_url %>). Because this e-mail address is connected to one registered on the imported archive, the associated fanworks (listed below) have been automatically added to your AO3 account.

  You can read announcements about recent archive moves at LF News (<%= root_url %>admin_posts?tag=18).

  If this is a mistake and these are not your works, please don't delete them! Please contact Open Doors (http://transformativeworks.org/contact/open%20doors) and we will sort it out.

  Depending on the archive, your works may have been imported restricted to registered users only (to keep them out of Google searches). If this is the case, the works will only be accessible by logged-in users unless you choose to make them fully visible. For help unlocking, orphaning, or deleting your works, please contact Support.

  These works were written under the e-mail: <%= @external_email %>
  <% @claimed_works.each do |work| %>
    - <%= work.title.html_safe %>  <%= work_url(work) %> <%= (work.fandom_string.blank? ? "" : " (#{work.fandom_string})") %>
  <% end %>

  To preserve rec lists and bookmarks, the imported archive's web addresses may redirect to the imported copy of these works for a limited time (check the announcement post for your archive to be sure). If you've already uploaded a copy of these works and you did NOT use the import from URL feature, there will be two copies of the same work on the archive.

  For other inquiries, please contact Support at <%= root_url %>support.
